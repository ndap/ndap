## 🚀 About Me

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm a **high school student** with big dreams and an even bigger passion for technology. While my classmates might be worried about pop quizzes, I'm here building the future, one line of code at a time.

### 🎯 What Drives Me
- **🌟 Aspiring Full Stack Developer** - From frontend magic to backend wizardry
- **💻 Programming Enthusiast** - I code for fun, passion, and endless possibilities
- **🗣️ Language Explorer** - Fluent in Indonesian, learning **日本語** and mastering English
- **🧮 Math Appreciation** - It's actually fun when it's not for school tests!

### 🎭 My Learning Style
I'm a **kinesthetic learner** at heart - I believe in learning by doing, not just reading. You'll find me:
- Building projects to understand concepts
- Breaking things to learn how they work
- Getting my hands dirty with real code
- Experimenting with new technologies
