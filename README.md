# Hey, I'm Dafa Ali!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a student who loves to explore cool stuff like:

- *Programming* (yep, I code for fun and projects)
- *Full stack development*
- *Languages* – I enjoy learning *日本語* and English
- *Math* – surprisingly fun when it's not for school tests

I'm more of a *kinesthetic learner*, so I learn best by doing — not just reading.

Feel free to check out my projects or hit me up if you wanna collab on something fun!
